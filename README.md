# Hotel-Management-System

The “Hotel Management System” is a web based application for computerised management of hotel records for the administrators of the hotel as well as for the guests to view their bookings . Here, guests have the option of viewing all their details, while the admins can use this software to manage bookings and reservations. Admins have their own login and password credentials and so do the users. Hence, this website helps the admins and guests to keep track of their booking status without having to physically travel to the hotel before their stay.
